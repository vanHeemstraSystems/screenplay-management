# 200 - Nx Cloud Monorepo of a Screenplay

I'll create an artifact that outlines how the screenplay elements could be structured as apps within an NX Cloud Monorepo.

Let me break down the NX Cloud Monorepo structure for the screenplay components:

1. **Monorepo Architecture**:
   - Each major screenplay element becomes a separate service or app
   - Separate services for: 
     - Screenplay Core
     - Act Service
     - Character Service
     - Scene Service
     - Slugline Service
     - Dialogue Service
     - Plot Point Service
     - Theme Service

2. **Key Design Principles**:
   - Shared core interfaces in `screenplay-core`
   - Microservice-like architecture
   - Each service responsible for its specific domain
   - Potential for independent deployment and scaling

3. **Service Responsibilities**:
   - `ActService`: Manages act-related operations
   - `SceneService`: Handles scene and slugline creation
   - `CharacterService`: Manages character arcs and dialogues
   - Each service can be developed, tested, and deployed independently

4. **NX Features Utilized**:
   - Project tagging
   - Workspace configurations
   - Potential for cloud-based distributed caching and task running
   - Generators for creating new screenplay-related apps

5. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - Cloud-native approach
   - Potential for serverless or containerized deployments
   - Independent scalability of services

The structure allows for:
- Modular development
- Independent scaling of different screenplay components
- Shared core interfaces
- Flexible architecture for screenplay management
